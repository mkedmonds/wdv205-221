                <h2>Research and Define CSS Terms</h2>

                <h3>Specificity</h3>
		<p>If there are two or more rules in the same element, the browser chooses one. IDs are considered higher values and will win most the time. The universal sign is too broad and will lose</p>

               <h3>Precedence</h3>
		<p>	How rules are cascaded in a website. It also states what rules are used in repetition. The order is: browser, external stylesheet, embedded styles, and inline styles</p>
              
              <h3>Inheritance</h3>
		<p>When a class is added to an element, the element becomes what the class says. For example, if you give a header a class that has a blue font color(.foo) and for a paragraph, you make a new class that says “inherit”, the paragraph with also have blue font.</p>
  
               <h3>Property</h3>
		<p>What you are changing. Properties are the elements like color or font. They are put before the values.</p>

               <h3>Value</h3>
		<p>What goes after the property. The property and value are separated by colons.</p>
                <p>For example:</p>
                <p>Color:blue;</p>
                <p>Font-size: 12px;</p>

              <h3>Selector</h3>
		<p>To find and assign properties to element. This can be based on id, class, or attribute.</p>
